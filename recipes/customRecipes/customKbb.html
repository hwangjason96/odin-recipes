        <p>Preface:<br>Every human being in the world should know how to make a good Kimchi Bokkeum Bap,
        The moment you discern the fact that we are <em>all</em> animals that sees and tastes the <strong>best</strong> of 
        each other, the more amazing things can be. Kimchi is a sign of this discernment, and this dish is the sign of strength in that understanding.</p>
        <p>Start with the ingredients (sorted in the order of importance in quality):</p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pompeian-100-Grapeseed-Oil-24-oz/22301261?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(required for vegetarian option) Grapeseed Oil</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.hmart.com/sliced-single-pork-belly--frozen-2lb-907g-/p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(optional) PORKBELLY</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.hmart.com/organic-cane-sugar-dark-1lb-454g-/p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(optional) Dark Sugar</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now the process</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack open the nicest eggs you found at the grocery store, do this over a metal bowl.</li>
            <li>Do you remember that one time you did bad in school, or you pissed off your mom somehow? Do you remember how she whisked the eggs that day? YEAH WE NEED THAT MUCH STRENGTH. WHISK IT FOR THE BISCUIT</li>
            <li>Take out the most beautiful sauced up vegetable to ever grace its existence upon our puny lives called kimch and put it on top of the cutting board. (Lay it gently, be performative. You only live once)</li>
            <li>If you are going vegetarian, take out any frying pan. If you are doing it my version, take out the non-stick frying pan.</li>
            <li>Pour the grapeseed oil onto the frying pan and gently move it so that it coats the whole pan. OR Start cooking the porkbelly on the non-stick pan. <strong>(HIGH HEAT)</strong></li>
            <li><p>Once the ingredients start cooking and searing really well, and you can see the <strong>oil</strong> boiling, that's when you put the <em>uncut</em> kimchi into the frying pan</p> 
                <p>(it will take a while for the porkbelly to cook and exude oil. once it is fully cooked, take out the porkbelly and put the kimchi in!)</p></li>
            <li>Once the kimchi is cooking in the oil, make sure you cook it on low heat. Make sure you hear the searing music</li>
            <li>When the music is humming and you see a little gold color coming from the kimchi, cut it using a cooking scissor into edible pieces</li>
            <li>When the kimchi is in edible pieces, cook the rice and pour the rice in (this should only take 2 minutes)</li>
            <li>Once the rice and the kimchi are both in the frying pan, start stirring and moving the ingredients around. You are performing magic right now, do you feel like a magician?</li>
            <li>Now that the kimchi and rice are nicely mixed (your rice should feel very separated from each other), whisk the eggs again from the bowl and pour it into the frying pan while whisking.</li>
            <li>MIX MIX MIX</li>
            <li>That took skill, high five if you made it this far. Now, for all of the anti-PETA animal loving folks, cut the cooked porkbelly into edible pieces and put it into the frying pan. <strong>STIR</strong></li>
            <li>While the whole concoction is in the pan, pour a teaspoon of soy sauce. (optional) Put some brown sugar to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve it like it is the last thing you will serve in your life. Plate it like it is the holy grail of your understanding in cuisine. You are the chef at a five star restaurant, and what you just did is make the most influential and important people cry with your ability to cook. The pope just called and asked about your cooking skills and wanted you to cater next week in Rome, BE THAT GUY.</li>
            <li>Now, pour a generous amount of sesame oil on your plate of Kimchi Bokkeum Bap.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You now have a BEAUTIFUL Kimchi Bokkeum bap.</p>
